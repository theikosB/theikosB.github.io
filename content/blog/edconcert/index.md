# Summary

Yeah so let's start from the begining
---

## Backstory
All this started with a sigh. A sigh! of despair, when I realised that not only was Ed Sheeran coming to Bangalore when I would be available there, but also all the tickets of the show are booked till the price range of 10k. The sigh was an expression that makes me think that I can't fulfill a wish I never knew I had, to attend a concert. Because that's what people college, people of my age normally do right? Why should I be denied of the opportunity?

PS: I got to know later, which did not calm me down, that the shows of 8th November (the date of concert) was booked within 3 mins of the time when the ticket window opened. How jobless are these people, I can't honestly sit infront of the computer (firstly I have to be updates with the arrival of Ed) always!

### Ticket Booking
So the opportunity came to me quite unexpedtedly, actually during a bus ride from Kolkata to Durgapur. I did went with my mother for a reason, otherwise she would be asleep by that time and I would be hesitant to call and ask for the matter. As I said, I was dissapointed previously. So was my friend group. It so happens that we get to meet an individual during our visit, who was playing Ed songs in his guitar! Needless to say, this required a rant to my mother regarding my failure to attend a live concert if this talented individual followed by me opening the bookmyshow website as a habit to prove my point and wait! There is a new show available. Apparently seeing the demand of Ed in Bengalore (result of being housefull in 3 mins) they decided to perform for one more day, on 9th.

So what do you think? I took permission from my mother and put the poll in the group. Quite strangely, only Adrija accepted to go with me (her excitement made up for the absence of other people tbh). (Did I get a hint that it's not expected of me by my parents of what I'm doing? Probably, but I thought it's new to all of us so let's try.) We got our tickets for 10k total, and we were relatively happy.


### Band-width
After reading the BookMyShow guidelines for the 10th time, I was actually worried when the Bands required for us to gain entry into the concert didn't arrive till 1st February. But obviously, it came, probably in one of the happiest moments of the day. I was having cheese Maggie, and got an invitation for another noodles treat, when I received the notification "your delivery is at your location". I went hurriedly, and collected a rather flat packet (I didn't know what to expect) which I assumed was carrying just the two bands (No idea how they look).
