# Summary

Yeah so let's start from the begining


10th Apr 9 p.m. IST
sudden powercut throughout campus
it was pitch black outside and the forest was looking haunted under the bloody red sky

They're saying there might not be electricity all night ðŸ˜³


The generator or something burst.
And repairing it needs digging and all to be done.
So unlikely to get fixed soon.

So we decided to enjoy the night in campus 
Madhu, Kangna, Arya moved to Saptagiri Layout 
The rest of us wanted to experience

Aanchal and I went out on a walk, called the rest of you, met at Raju Kaku's and had stuff
I had icecream and you guys had noodles as far as I remember

Then we returned and I wanted to take a bath in the dark and decided to go for it
I also filled up Aanchal's bucket in which she dropped her phone later on coz she couldn't see and her phone gone bhoger bari
And I couldn't judge the amount of surf Excel and managed to turn the washroom into a cloud

Then Aanchal and I tortured Suryansh with beshuro songs very happily
Then you guys joined us and called us to common room
Best and longest game of Mafia ever 
Mafia r detail tui lekh amar oto bhalo kore mone nei

Malav Da joined in and started gaaner session with me, Ruchira di and Aanchal
You guys left to play board games in MY room without asking me such idiots
Anyways...you guys played 
We sang
Then I called, asked where you were
Gave me 1000s of chances I couldn't guess
Tora bolar por ami firlam ghore 
Called Anit da, played Scotland Yard
You detective, took away one advantage detectives could stay in place
In any case you got stuck at a point and lost

Shesh hote hote shokal
We went to chhad
Idk what we did there
Spotted Sarbartha, tar i shamne ami ar samadrita ektu pda korlam ðŸ˜‚

Then we went to F2
GOROM GOROM GOROM
tora ghumiye porli
ami rings niye boshlam 
shobar phone e charge shesh

me no ghum coz too gorom
then me smell REAL BAD stuff
pechone ghure dekhi BANDOR janlay boshe

Oh na wait tar aagee ami ar samadrita khaate shuye reel dekhe HESHE KUTOPATI
and tui ar suryansh ig chess
Then jhapajhapi, lafalafi, double displacement

then me wake up suryansh and shoo away bandor

Then I see butterscotch icecream being served in mess so I go with suryansh to eat you two ghum

Khelam, F7 e giye ghumonor cheshta korlam, labh nei 
kichhutei ghumote parlam na
then it was 12 or something 
decided to go to Hotel
Only your phone had charge

Tor phone diye ami contact maa and then hotel

We take auto (booking problem coz no net and no charge)

we reach
only 4 of us
bakira with their own reasons 
pishir bari, mall, layout, blah blah

Hotel room
Bihari mess grand 
Doi fuchka?

me lost (me eat separately tora khuje pashni diye amake diye thushiyechhish jor kore khabar ar bokechhish)
then momo, durba r video call
then room
then mosti
key break, weird manage
401 e bluff 
me go sleep 
(you may or may not add the room scam)

aritrabha khali
ami bari jabo hostel jabo ghore ghumobo ar oke amra dhore rakhchhi
you miss sammy
aritrabha leave early morning coz POSH

then you give us tara
so we pack quickly and leave by 10
then we reach, you go sleep (or that's what we thought)
so we order food without you
you mad
tarpor baki ar mone nei
