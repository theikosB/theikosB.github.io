# About

{{< lead >}}  
Who are we even?  
{{< /lead >}}  

Welcome to my little corner of the internet. I’m **Daibik Barik**, a third-year undergrad at the [Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore Centre](https://www.isibang.ac.in) — a place where math gets serious and the coffee even more so.

This blog is a space for me to explore and share that curiosity — whether through math, stories, projects, or just things I find cool and worth writing about. I’m hoping it becomes a space where ideas can bounce around, grow, and maybe even surprise me once in a while.

## Who am I?

I’m Daibik — a second-year undergrad who just really enjoys figuring things out. I’ve always been curious about how things work beneath the surface, especially when it comes to math. Patterns, probabilities, structures — I don’t always get them right away, but there’s something satisfying about slowly making sense of a tricky idea. I’m drawn to problems that make you pause, whether it’s a strange twist in graph theory or an unexpected result in probability.

At ISI, you’ll usually find me somewhere between the classroom, the mess, and late-night walks with friends that somehow turn into philosophical (or graph-theoretic) debates. I’m always looking to connect the abstract with the real, and I have this habit of seeing metaphors everywhere — maybe too often, but hey, it keeps things interesting.

### Academics

Right now, I’m in my second year of the B.Math program at ISI Bangalore.

My current academic interests lie in **combinatorics**, **graph theory**, and **probability**, though I often stray into **real analysis**, **discrete math**, and whatever feels intellectually itchy at the moment.

I try to get involved in research-style projects whenever I can — not because I have everything figured out (I definitely don’t), but because I enjoy the process of sitting with an unfamiliar idea and trying to untangle it bit by bit. Sometimes it leads somewhere interesting, sometimes it doesn’t — but even then, I usually walk away with better questions, and that feels like a win.

**What about other subjects?**  
Though math is my home turf, I’ve dipped my toes into computer science, physics, linguistics, and even storytelling. I like connecting dots between disciplines — that’s where some of the most beautiful ideas hide.

### Outside the Curriculum

Turns out, college isn’t just about problem sets and deadlines — I’ve also been part of a few clubs and events that bring a bit of unpredictability (and fun) to the mix.

- With the **Chess Club**, I’ve helped organize various tournaments — including a multi-format intra-college series and a Variants Tour featuring some truly weird and fun chess versions. We also conducted “**CHECKMATE**,” the open chess tournament during our annual cultural fest, **CHAOS**. Planning it all was as strategic as playing it.

- In the **Cultural Committee**, I helped put together events like Holi, Diwali, and Saraswati Puja — the kind of stuff that makes campus feel festive and a little less academic for a while. We also ran a campus-wide Treasure Hunt, hosted gaming evenings, handled merch distribution across over 100 students, and helped plan big moments like Freshers and Farewell. I was also part of the team behind **CHAOS**, our annual fest.

- With the **Movie Committee**, I helped run weekly screenings of movies and matches in the college auditorium. We’d set up polls, take suggestions, and try to keep things fun and crowd-friendly.

- Back in school at **DAV Model**, I was the **Discipline Captain (Boys)** — helping keep things running on time, handling weekly check-ins, and managing the rhythm of everyday school life. I also helped lead charity drives that collected items from over 6000 students and raised funds for orphanages and old age homes. Add to that co-organizing Teachers' Day, Annual Day, Award Night — yeah, school kept me busy too.

## Why Start a Blog?

I’ve been meaning to start something like this for a while — a space to write, reflect, and collect ideas that would otherwise just stay in my notes app or a fading notebook margin.

It’s partly for fun, partly for memory, and partly because I think putting thoughts into words sharpens them. I also want to connect with others — whether you're into math, ideas, stories, or just here by accident. (Welcome either way.)

## Adios

That’s all for now. If you made it this far — thank you!  
I hope this blog grows into something thoughtful and messy and honest, like most good things are.

Let’s see what comes next :).
