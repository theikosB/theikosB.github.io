Hello there! This is my first blog post, as is evidenced by the title.  
\
If you're reading this, you are either a friend, a family member, or a curious stranger who stumbled upon this blog. Either way, thanks for stopping by! It means a lot to me. I'm excited to share my thoughts, experiences, and passions with all of you. This blog will serve as a space for me to express myself, discuss my interests, and connect with like-minded people. I’m also looking forward to learning from those who might disagree or bring new perspectives. Let’s grow together on this journey!

As of now, I am in my **second year** at ISI Bangalore. My mathematical interests lie in areas such as **Probability Theory**, **Graph Theory**, **Statistical Inference**, and **Cryptography**. I actively participate in several activities at the institute, including being a part of the following:

**What about other subjects?**  
Though my degree is focused on pure mathematics, I actively explore interdisciplinary topics, often diving into physics, computer science, and even linguistics for a fresh perspective.

### Hobbies
Even though I am unsure about the topics I should pursue, that never stops me from building 100s of other interest in various other fields.
- **Photography**, (Participated and won in _Shuttersbug_, a school level photography competition)
- **Chess** (FIDE Rated: 1576 in blitz)
- **Watching movies**, having frequently being termed as "watch-it-all" by my friends, I enjoy movies in every genre and plots and hence this obsession.
- **Reading**, interest in reading English and Bengali poems, short stories, clasical novels, even articles if I find them interesting.
- **Listening to Music**, have a look in my <a href= "https://open.spotify.com/user/pv327c8kr3lcp1m2ota0tzgun" target="_blank">spotify account</a>

## Why Start a Blog?  

This blog is my little corner on the internet where I can document my journey, share knowledge, and build an online presence. It’s a way to centralize my work and thoughts, instead of scattering them across platforms. Writing here also gives me a creative outlet to express myself while keeping it accessible to friends, family, and curious strangers like you.
