Hello there! This is my first blog post, as is evidenced by the title.  
\
If you're reading this, you are either a friend, a family member, or a curious stranger who stumbled upon this blog. Either way, thanks for stopping by! It means a lot to me. I'm excited to share my thoughts, experiences, and passions with all of you. This blog will serve as a space for me to express myself, discuss my interests, and connect with like-minded people. I’m also looking forward to learning from those who might disagree or bring new perspectives. Let’s grow together on this journey!

## Who am I?

Well, I am **Daibik Barik**, currently pursuing my **Bachelor’s in Mathematics (Honours)** at the prestigious [Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore Centre](https://www.isibang.ac.in).  

### Academics  
As of now, I am in my **second year** at ISI Bangalore. My mathematical interests lie in areas such as **Probability Theory**, **Graph Theory**, **Statistical Inference**, and **Cryptography**. I actively participate in several activities at the institute, including being a part of the following:  
- **Cultural Committee**: Collaborating to organize vibrant and diverse events throughout the year.  
- **Math Club of ISI Bangalore**: Engaging in discussions, competitions, and events focused on exploring advanced mathematical concepts.  
- **Technical Team Head of Limit**: Managing the technical aspects of the [Limit Examination](https://limitisi.in/), organized by ISI students and researchers.

**What about other subjects?**  
Though my degree is focused on pure mathematics, I actively explore interdisciplinary topics, often diving into physics, computer science, and even linguistics for a fresh perspective.

## Hobbies  

I believe in maintaining a balance between academics and personal interests. Here’s a glimpse into some of the things I enjoy:  

- **Reading**: Books, papers, and everything in between! I’m particularly drawn to mathematical writings, history, and thought-provoking fiction.  
- **Chess**: A game of strategy and patience. I’ve recently gained my **FIDE rating** in blitz and rapid chess, thanks to the encouragement of my friends. I also represented ISI Bangalore in the **India College Chess Championship**.  
- **Writing**: Whether it’s poetry or academic writing, I find joy in expressing my thoughts through words.  
- **Competitive Programming**: Though not heavily competitive, I enjoy problem-solving and participating in coding challenges for fun.  
- **Movies, Series, and Anime**: I’m always up for recommendations—if it’s got a gripping plot, I’m all in!  
- **Exploring Languages**: I have a knack for languages, from understanding German basics to exploring linguistic structures in different tongues.

## Why Start a Blog?  

This blog is my little corner on the internet where I can document my journey, share knowledge, and build an online presence. It’s a way to centralize my work and thoughts, instead of scattering them across platforms. Writing here also gives me a creative outlet to express myself while keeping it accessible to friends, family, and curious strangers like you.
