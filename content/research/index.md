<div style="text-align: justify">As my studies are research based (as in I <i>want</i> to research in future, and not like my current research is contributing highly to the society and I deserve a Nobel for that!), I decided it was best to create a separate page dedicated to my internships, experiences, talks and papers as to keep them together, which makes it easy to manage.</div>
