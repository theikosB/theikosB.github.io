As my studies are research based (as in I _want_ to research in future, and not like my current research is contributing highly to the society and I deserve a Nobel for that!), I decided it was best to ceate a separate page dedicated to my internships, experiences, talks and papers as to keep them together, which makes it easy to manage.

## Research Internships

- **Research Commons, Mathematics Research Intern** *(Remote)*  
    - Preparing a curriculum for research-based studies in India on various topics in mathematics.  
    - Collaborated with undergrads from IITs and BITs.
