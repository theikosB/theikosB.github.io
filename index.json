A sigh! of despair, when I realised that not only was Ed Sheeran coming to Bangalore when I would be available there, but also all the tickets of the show are booked till the price range of 10k. The sigh was an expression that makes me think that I can\u0026rsquo;t fulfill a wish I never knew I had, to attend a concert. Because that\u0026rsquo;s what people college, people of my age normally do right? Why should I be denied of the opportunity?\nPS: I got to know later, which did not calm me down, that the shows of 8th November (the date of concert) was booked within 3 mins of the time when the ticket window opened. How jobless are these people, I can\u0026rsquo;t honestly sit infront of the computer (firstly I have to be updates with the arrival of Ed) always!\nTicket Booking # So the opportunity came to me quite unexpedtedly, actually during a bus ride from Kolkata to Durgapur. I did went with my mother for a reason, otherwise she would be asleep by that time and I would be hesitant to call and ask for the matter. As I said, I was dissapointed previously. So was my friend group. It so happens that we get to meet an individual during our visit, who was playing Ed songs in his guitar! Needless to say, this required a rant to my mother regarding my failure to attend a live concert if this talented individual followed by me opening the bookmyshow website as a habit to prove my point and wait! There is a new show available. Apparently seeing the demand of Ed in Bengalore (result of being housefull in 3 mins) they decided to perform for one more day, on 9th.\nSo what do you think? I took permission from my mother and put the poll in the group. Quite strangely, only Adrija accepted to go with me (her excitement made up for the absence of other people tbh). (Did I get a hint that it\u0026rsquo;s not expected of me by my parents of what I\u0026rsquo;m doing? Probably, but I thought it\u0026rsquo;s new to all of us so let\u0026rsquo;s try.) We got our tickets for 10k total, and we were relatively happy.\nBand-width # After reading the BookMyShow guidelines for the 10th time, I was actually worried when the Bands required for us to gain entry into the concert didn\u0026rsquo;t arrive till 1st February. But obviously, it came, probably in one of the happiest moments of the day. I was having cheese Maggie, and got an invitation for another noodles treat, when I received the notification \u0026ldquo;your delivery is at your location\u0026rdquo;. I went hurriedly, and collected a rather flat packet (I didn\u0026rsquo;t know what to expect) which I assumed was carrying just the two bands (No idea how they look).\nDay Loading\u0026hellip; # (talk) + (pulao) + (antichess) + (Coc) + (BoM)\nThe Event Day # Preparation and leave # (The Shivangi story hint should be given)\nThe Metro Ride # (Rings)\nRealization: (+BBC Diss)\nPlan change\nThe Peacock Layout # (Detour) + (Temple) + (Village Scene) + (Vid call \u0026amp; Google Maps) + (Peacock Layout!!) + (Cricket) + (Crack in wall) + (Feild destruction) + (Frooti + Milk + Lemon tea \u0026amp; Dp) + (uncle shocks Gmaps)\nInside NICE Grounds # (The line) + (directions category, band colour) + (bag checking- bottle) + (Mali) + (crowd navigation, random direction choice gone right + A hand hold) + (sayak meetup) + (ed-concert) + (screen description) + (long time stand) + (crowd, especially my neighbour, the selfie tooth guy who comes at last and the inside jokes) + (realisation about shit phone, but later revelation) + (famous songs at last) + (desicion to leave)\nComing Back # (returning songs) + (bottle find) + (the street vendors) + (metro checking) + (the train sleep) + (majestic beggars) + (uber + dominos book) + (the auto moment) + (wait for dominos)\nOther Events # (A surprise!- secret?)\n","date":"5 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/edconcert/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"Ed Sheeran Concert!","type":"blog"},{"content":" About # Who are we even? Hello there! This is my first blog post, as is evidenced by the title.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re reading this, you are either a friend, a family member, or a curious stranger who stumbled upon this blog. Either way, thanks for stopping by! It means a lot to me. I\u0026rsquo;m excited to share my thoughts, experiences, and passions with all of you. This blog will serve as a space for me to express myself, discuss my interests, and connect with like-minded people. I’m also looking forward to learning from those who might disagree or bring new perspectives. Let’s grow together on this journey!\nWho am I? # Well, I am Daibik Barik, currently pursuing my Bachelor’s in Mathematics (Honours) at the prestigious Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore Centre.\nAcademics # As of now, I am in my second year at ISI Bangalore. My mathematical interests lie in areas such as Probability Theory, Graph Theory, Statistical Inference, and Cryptography. I actively participate in several activities at the institute, including being a part of the following:\nCultural Committee: Collaborating to organize vibrant and diverse events throughout the year. Math Club of ISI Bangalore: Engaging in discussions, competitions, and events focused on exploring advanced mathematical concepts. Technical Team Head of Limit: Managing the technical aspects of the Limit Examination, organized by ISI students and researchers. What about other subjects?\nThough my degree is focused on pure mathematics, I actively explore interdisciplinary topics, often diving into physics, computer science, and even linguistics for a fresh perspective. Hobbies # Even though I am unsure about the topics I should pursue, that never stops me from building 100s of other interest in various other fields.\nPhotography, (Participated and won in Shuttersbug, a school level photography competition) Chess (FIDE Rated: 1576 in blitz) Watching movies, having frequently being termed as \u0026ldquo;watch-it-all\u0026rdquo; by my friends, I enjoy movies in every genre and plots and hence this obsession. Reading, interest in reading English and Bengali poems, short stories, clasical novels, even articles if I find them interesting. Listening to Music, have a look in my spotify account Painting, passed 4th year under Bengal Arts Association Outdoor Sports (Badminton, Swimming, Cricket etc.) Why Start a Blog? # This blog is my little corner on the internet where I can document my journey, share knowledge, and build an online presence. It’s a way to centralize my work and thoughts, instead of scattering them across platforms. Writing here also gives me a creative outlet to express myself while keeping it accessible to friends, family, and curious strangers like you.\nAdios # That’s all for now! I hope this gave you a glimpse into who I am and what I’m passionate about. Feel free to explore my newer posts for more updates and insights.\nThank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy this journey with me!\nRecent Semester 1 18 December 2024 Semester 2 18 December 2024 ","date":"24 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/firstpost/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"First Post: Introduction!","type":"blog"},{"content":" This blog is a place for updates to the randomest (and sometimes not so) things that happen in my life.
