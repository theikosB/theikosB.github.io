[{"content":" About # Who are we even? Hello there! This is my first blog post, as is evidenced by the title.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re reading this, you are either a friend, a family member, or a curious stranger who stumbled upon this blog. Either way, thanks for stopping by! It means a lot to me. I\u0026rsquo;m excited to share my thoughts, experiences, and passions with all of you. This blog will serve as a space for me to express myself, discuss my interests, and connect with like-minded people. I’m also looking forward to learning from those who might disagree or bring new perspectives. Let’s grow together on this journey!\nWho am I? # Well, I am Daibik Barik, currently pursuing my Bachelor’s in Mathematics (Honours) at the prestigious Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore Centre.\nAcademics # As of now, I am in my second year at ISI Bangalore. My mathematical interests lie in areas such as Probability Theory, Graph Theory, Statistical Inference, and Cryptography. I actively participate in several activities at the institute, including being a part of the following:\nCultural Committee: Collaborating to organize vibrant and diverse events throughout the year. Math Club of ISI Bangalore: Engaging in discussions, competitions, and events focused on exploring advanced mathematical concepts. Technical Team Head of Limit: Managing the technical aspects of the Limit Examination, organized by ISI students and researchers. What about other subjects?\nThough my degree is focused on pure mathematics, I actively explore interdisciplinary topics, often diving into physics, computer science, and even linguistics for a fresh perspective. Hobbies # I believe in maintaining a balance between academics and personal interests. Here’s a glimpse into some of the things I enjoy:\nReading: Books, papers, and everything in between! I’m particularly drawn to mathematical writings, history, and thought-provoking fiction. Chess: A game of strategy and patience. I’ve recently gained my FIDE rating in blitz and rapid chess, thanks to the encouragement of my friends. I also represented ISI Bangalore in the India College Chess Championship. Writing: Whether it’s poetry or academic writing, I find joy in expressing my thoughts through words. Competitive Programming: Though not heavily competitive, I enjoy problem-solving and participating in coding challenges for fun. Movies, Series, and Anime: I’m always up for recommendations—if it’s got a gripping plot, I’m all in! Exploring Languages: I have a knack for languages, from understanding German basics to exploring linguistic structures in different tongues. Why Start a Blog? # This blog is my little corner on the internet where I can document my journey, share knowledge, and build an online presence. It’s a way to centralize my work and thoughts, instead of scattering them across platforms. Writing here also gives me a creative outlet to express myself while keeping it accessible to friends, family, and curious strangers like you.\nAdios # That’s all for now! I hope this gave you a glimpse into who I am and what I’m passionate about. Feel free to explore my newer posts for more updates and insights.\nThank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy this journey with me!\nRecent About Me 283 words ","date":"18 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/firstpost/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"First Post: Introduction!","type":"blog"},{"content":" I\u0026rsquo;m a teenage college student, who is overwhelmed by the lots and lots of topics and his interests in real life.
