[{"content":" About # Who are we even? Hello there! This is my first blog post, as is evidenced by the title.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re reading this, you are either a friend, a family member, or a curious stranger who stumbled upon this blog. Either way, thanks for stopping by! It means a lot to me. I\u0026rsquo;m excited to share my thoughts, experiences, and passions with all of you. This blog will serve as a space for me to express myself, discuss my interests, and connect with like-minded people. I’m also looking forward to learning from those who might disagree or bring new perspectives. Let’s grow together on this journey!\nWho am I? # Well, I am Daibik Barik, currently pursuing my Bachelor’s in Mathematics (Honours) at the prestigious Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore Centre.\nAcademics # As of now, I am in my second year at ISI Bangalore. My mathematical interests lie in areas such as Probability Theory, Graph Theory, Statistical Inference, and Cryptography. I actively participate in several activities at the institute, including being a part of the following:\nCultural Committee: Collaborating to organize vibrant and diverse events throughout the year. Math Club of ISI Bangalore: Engaging in discussions, competitions, and events focused on exploring advanced mathematical concepts. Technical Team Head of Limit: Managing the technical aspects of the Limit Examination, organized by ISI students and researchers. What about other subjects?\nThough my degree is focused on pure mathematics, I actively explore interdisciplinary topics, often diving into physics, computer science, and even linguistics for a fresh perspective. Hobbies # Even though I am unsure about the topics I should pursue, that never stops me from building 100s of other interest in various other fields.\nPhotography, (Participated and won in Shuttersbug, a school level photography competition) Chess (FIDE Rated: 1576 in blitz) Watching movies, having frequently being termed as \u0026ldquo;watch-it-all\u0026rdquo; by my friends, I enjoy movies in every genre and plots and hence this obsession. Reading, interest in reading English and Bengali poems, short stories, clasical novels, even articles if I find them interesting. Listening to Music, have a look in my spotify account Painting, passed 4th year under Bengal Arts Association Outdoor Sports (Badminton, Swimming, Cricket etc.) Why Start a Blog? # This blog is my little corner on the internet where I can document my journey, share knowledge, and build an online presence. It’s a way to centralize my work and thoughts, instead of scattering them across platforms. Writing here also gives me a creative outlet to express myself while keeping it accessible to friends, family, and curious strangers like you.\nAdios # That’s all for now! I hope this gave you a glimpse into who I am and what I’m passionate about. Feel free to explore my newer posts for more updates and insights.\nThank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy this journey with me!\nRecent Semester 1 18 December 2024 ","date":"18 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/firstpost/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"First Post: Introduction!","type":"blog"},{"content":"","date":"18 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/study/semester-1/","section":"Study Materials","summary":"","title":"Semester 1","type":"study"},{"content":"","date":"18 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/study/semester-2/","section":"Study Materials","summary":"","title":"Semester 2","type":"study"},{"content":" I am using this page to list out (kind of like a journal for academics) the activites which I do both during the academic semesters and over the breaks. 2025 # Academic Semester IV # Gave a talk on Fuzzy Set Theory. \u0026lt;a href==\u0026quot;/research/#talks-given\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Refer here under Math Club, ISI Bangalore.
